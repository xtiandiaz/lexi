# Lexi

A simple, gamified app to exercise and expand your vocabulary.

Additionally, this project is being developed as a learning task with 2 open-source frameworks:
1. [Godot](./godot/) (technically a game engine, of course), and 
2. [Vue](./vue/) (WIP)

The initiative is also for the sake of comparison between the 2 in terms of ease of production and deployment, for this kind of products.

The collected vocabulary so far is of personal attainment, extracted from regular reading, discussion and reflection.

Feel free to clone, fork and use as the start or a branch of your own initiative.
